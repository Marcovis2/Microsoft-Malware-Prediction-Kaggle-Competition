# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction

Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware.
Microsoft is providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.

The dataset provided by Microsoft for this research competition is quite large (about 4 GB) and you may encounter problems if you are running these data mining and ML algorithms locally on your machine. My scripts can run on my Lenovo Legion Y720 Cube with Intel i7-7700 CPU, 16 GB DDR4 memory and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU.
As you can see I anyway had to split the code in 7 different steps otherwise the workload would have been to high for my machine especially in terms of memory saturation. Also the final prediction work had to be split in order to overcome memory limitations.
