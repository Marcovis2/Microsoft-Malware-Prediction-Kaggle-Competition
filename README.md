# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction

The malware industry continues to be a well-organized, well-funded market dedicated to evading traditional security measures. Once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways. 

With more than one billion enterprise and consumer customers, Microsoft takes this problem very seriously and is deeply invested in improving security. 

As one part of their overall strategy for doing so, Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware. As with their previous, Malware Challenge (2015), Microsoft is providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.

Can you help protect more than one billion machines from damage BEFORE it happens?

The dataset provided by Microsoft for this research competition is very large (about 4 GB) and you may encounter problems if you are running the code locally on your machine. My scripts can run on my Lenovo Legion Y720 Cube with Intel i7-7700 CPU, 16 GB DDR4 memory and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU.
As you can see I anyway had to split the code in 7 different steps otherwise the workload would have been to high for my machine especially in terms of memory saturation.
